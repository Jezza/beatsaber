### Beatsaver Library (Beatsaber Maps Library)

I'm writing this as I'm about to go into work, so I'll just keep it simple.

* An API to query Maps from the beatsaver website.
  * Pager support

I'll add support for mods as well, but right now, I'm working on a GUI that's
focusing on the maps, so for now, that's where my attention is...

If you want an example on how to use it take a look at `src/bin/main.rs`,
because the documentation is so shit/non-existent.
